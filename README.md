# Panoramic-X-ray-images-from-CBCT
This project presents a pipeline to generate panoramic X-ray images from 3D CBCT scans. Unlike traditional 2D radiographs, our method synthesizes panoramic views from volumetric data, enabling retrospective analysis and improved visualization for dental and maxillofacial applications.
